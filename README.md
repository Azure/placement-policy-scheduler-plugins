# Placement Policy Scheduler Plugins

Most of cloud environments today provides cluster admins with ephemeral nodes (VMs). These nodes typically cost significantly less but they offer less reliability than their regular counterpart. Cluster admins are often torn between the choice of cost and reliability because of the innate inability of the default Kubernetes scheduler to place some of a specific workload pods on these nodes. Having the entire workload on ephemeral nodes risks the reliability of the workload when the cloud environment stops these nodes.

This scheduler enables cluster admins to offload some configurable percentage of their workloads on these nodes enabling them to decrease the cost of running these pods without affecting its reliability. The scheduler is implemented using the [scheduler framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/) with two additional plugins. The scheduler will run side by side with existing kubernetes scheduler and users will have to [specifically specify this scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/) to use for their workloads that perform the following:

- A scorer plugin implemented with that will be used in case ‚Äúbest effort‚Äù policy enforcement.
  - Extension points implemented: [PreScore](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#pre-score) and [Score](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#score)
- A filter plugin that will be used in case ‚Äúforce‚Äù policy enforcement.
  - Extension points implemented: [PreFilter](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#pre-filter) and [Filter](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#filter)

**NOTE:** This code is in **ALPHA** status. It is not considered ready for production use.

## Quick Start

### Install

The container images for the scheduler plugin is available in the github container registry.

#### Quick Install

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins/main/deploy/kube-scheduler-configuration.yml
```

</details><br/>

#### Helm

```bash
helm repo add placement-policy-scheduler-plugins https://azure.github.io/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins/charts
helm repo update

helm install -n kube-system [RELEASE_NAME] placement-policy-scheduler-plugins/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins
```

### Example config

```yaml
apiVersion: placement-policy.scheduling.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlacementPolicy
metadata:
  name: besteffort-must
spec:
  weight: 100
  enforcementMode: BestEffort
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node: want
  policy:
    action: Must
    targetSize: 40%
```

- **enforcementMode**: specifies how the policy will be enforced during scheduler. Values allowed for this field are:
  - **BestEffort** (default): the policy will be enforced as best effort (scorer mode).
  - **Strict**: the policy will be forced during scheduling.
- **nodeSelector**: selects the nodes where the placement policy will apply on according to action.
- **podSelector**: identifies which pods this placement policy will apply on
- **action**: policy placement action that carries the following possible values:
  - **Must**(default): based on the rule below pods must be placed on nodes selected by node selector MustNot: based on the rule pods
  - **MustNot** be placed nodes selected by node selector'
- **targetSize**: the number or percent of pods that can or cannot be placed on the node.
- **weight**: allows the engine to decide which policy to use when pods match multiple policies.

### Demo

#### 1. Create a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster with the following config

```sh
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name placement-policy --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
    - |
      kind: JoinConfiguration
      nodeRegistration:
        kubeletExtraArgs:
          node-labels: "node=want"
- role: worker
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
    - |
      kind: JoinConfiguration
      nodeRegistration:
        kubeletExtraArgs:
          node-labels: "node=want"
- role: worker
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
    - |
      kind: JoinConfiguration
      nodeRegistration:
        kubeletExtraArgs:
          node-labels: "node=unwant"
EOF
```

>The same node selector `node: want` will be used as node label for `kind-worker` and `kind-worker2`

<details>
<summary>Node labels</summary>

```bash
‚ûú kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,LABEL:.metadata.labels['node']"
NAME                 LABEL

kind-worker          want
kind-worker2         want
kind-worker3         unwant
```

</details><br/>

#### 2. Follow the [Install](#install) section to deploy placement-policy-scheduler-plugins as a secondary scheduler

#### 3. Deploy a `PlacementPolicy` CRD
  
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins/main/examples/v1alpha1_placementpolicy_strict_must.yml
```
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```
placementpolicy.placement-policy.scheduling.x-k8s.io/strict-must created
```
</details><br/>

#### 4. Deploy a `ReplicaSet` that will create 10 replicas

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins/main/examples/demo_replicaset.yml
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```

</details><br/>

#### 5. Get pods with matching labels

```sh
kubectl get po -o wide -l app=nginx

nginx-vq598   1/1     Running   0          76s   10.244.3.7   kind-worker3   <none>           <none>
nginx-xzxsb   1/1     Running   0          76s   10.244.3.3   kind-worker3   <none>           <none>

```

We will find the nodes which carry the same node selector defined in the strict-must `PlacementPolicy` have been assigned 40% of the workload as defined with `targetSize`.

#### 6. Clean up

- Delete [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster

```bash
kind delete cluster --name placement-policy
```
